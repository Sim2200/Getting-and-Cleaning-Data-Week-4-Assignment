# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA WEEK 4 PROJECT

This project is made for week 4 of coursera's getting and cleaning data course.

[Site] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Here is the data for the project:
[Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)


## TASK

To create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## FILES

This repository contains the following files:

`README.md` - for the overview of the project.
`run_analysis.R` - which contains the final R code.
`CodeBook.md` -  which describes the variables, the data, and the transformations that were performed to clean up the data.
`tidyDataSet` - which contains the final tidy dataset.
